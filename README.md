# ASSAMEE
ASSAMEE is a free advanced encryption tool that can be used to encrypt files and directories and store them on Anonfiles.com. It uses AES-256 encryption, which is a strong and secure encryption method. To access the encrypted files, a download ID is required to decrypt and download the data from Anonfiles.com. It's important to note that it is not possible to download the encrypted data directly from the browser, as it can only be accessed by using a download ID.

To use ASSAMEE, you need to install several packages on your computer. These packages are required for the proper functioning of the tool and need to be installed with the PKG installer option in the ASSAMEE console. The PKG installer option will help you to install the required packages and make sure that the tool is fully functional. Once the required packages are installed, you can use the tool to encrypt and store your files and directories on Anonfiles.com in a secure way.
